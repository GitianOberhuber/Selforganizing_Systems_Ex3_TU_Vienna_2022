This is our project for the lecture Selforganizing Systems at TU Vienna, Exercise 3. The goal of this exercise is to implement a mnemonic SOM [1]. We extend the MiniSom library (https://github.com/JustGlowing/minisom) by adding options to train mnemonic SOMs. We then use SOMToolb (https://github.com/smnishko/SOMToolbox/) for visualizing our results. Our results and a report is given in coding.ipynb
